# SudokuSolver
Solves Sudoku puzzles up to 9x9.
That's pretty much it! The format is provided in the PDF requirements.

Also, my project uses a special internal format (5x5 for 4x4s, 10x10 for 9x9s)
to store the puzzle so I can index from 1 instead of from 0.
If you're interested in reading about it, it's documented in Sudoku.java.

Puzzles can be input in 4x4 or 9x9, or in my extra-row/col format.
Enjoy! Please credit me if you reuse this code.
